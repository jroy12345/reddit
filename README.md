# 221 Data Curation and Management Reddit r/TheRedPill

This repository contains the code that we have used in our project so far.

Our zenodo link available [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6474336) contains all of the datasets used between analysis files.
The files were too large to be hosted directly on github.

trp_data_grabber.ipynb contains the API calls to collect the data from the Pushshift Archive and outputs the trp_submissions and trp_comments json objects.

clean_data_initial takes in trp_comments.json and returns the filtered_comments_json.

analysis_RQ1.ipynb creates the visualizations to answer the first research question.

clean_data_RQ2 takes in the filtered_comments.json as well as the lexicon dictionaries courtesy of:

Their github is available [here](https://github.com/miriamfs/WebSci2019). The notebook returns the comments_rq2.json file.

analysis_RQ1.ipynb creates the visualizations to answer the first research question.
analysis_RQ2.ipynb creates the visualizations to answer the second research question.

The order to run files is as follows:
1. trp_data_grabber.ipynb
2. clean_data_initial.ipynb
3. analysis_RQ1.ipynb
4. clean_data_RQ2.ipynb
5. analysis_RQ2.ipynb
