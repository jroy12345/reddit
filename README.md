# 221 Data Curation and Management Reddit r/TheRedPill

This repository contains the code that we have used in our project so far.

trp_data_grabber.ipynb contains the API calls to collect the data from the Pushshift Archive.

The collected data for both the submission and comments data resides at a zenodo link available [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6386942).

The filtered data after 'clean_data_RQ1.ipynb' is available [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6468360).


clean_data.ipynb takes in the json datatables available at the zenodo link and converts this to workable dataframes. It has a data sanity check at the bottom to confirm which months are present in the dataset.
